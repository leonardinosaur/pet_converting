# pet_converting
This repo is a set of scripts dedicated to converting PET images into DICOM files. In a research setting, it is
common to convert away from DICOM and into formats such as Nifti and MGH. In clinical settings, however,
many of the programs for viewing images operate on DICOM formatted files.

## Basic usage

## Requirements
Python 2.7, Nibabel, Pandas, Pydicom, and the Python Mango Scripting API.
